Building Aften with CMake
==========================

The aim of using CMake is making portable development easier, as CMake
contains generators for various build systems. On e.g. *nix Makefiles
will be built, and on Windows MS VC++ project files, if you wish. You
can get CMake at http://cmake.org/.

This document explains briefly how to build with CMake on Linux via an
out-of-tree build:

   - Change to the toplevel directory containing the Aften sources.
   - Create a directory, e.g. "default", and change into it.
   - Now run something like:

        cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:STRING="/usr"
        make
        make install

     If you exported your CFLAGS, there is no need to specify them
     explicitly, as CMake will pick them up.

   - Aften should get installed as you got used to it.

I really would like to get CMake building Aften on every supported
platform. So please contact me if it doesn't build on yours. I'll try to
fix this with your help.

Some tips:

   - You can use a console GUI named ccmake for configuring cmake. This
     also comes in handy, to find out about available options. You can
     also set options via command-line:

        ccmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:STRING="/usr"

     sets the two variables defined on command line and then starts the
     GUI. Press 'c' the first time and every time you want to commit
     changes in the config. Finally press 'g' to run the generator. Btw,
     to set boolean vars from the command line, use -DVAR:BOOL=X, where
     X is eg. ON or OFF.

   - If you want more output at compile time, use

        make VERBOSE=1

   - If you want to install to a different directory (using same
     prefix), use

        make install DESTDIR=/foo/bar

   - CMake doesn't has a distclean target by default, so you better
     really do an out-of-tree build, then you can simply delete its
     content when you want a distclean... Furthermore it is easier to
     have different builds using different parameters via out-of-tree
     builds.

   - If you are interested in variables to set, take a look into
     CMakeCache.txt after having run the configuring stage.

   - If you update your source tree via cvs and want to rebuild an
     previously built lib without cleaning, you better at least clear
     the CMake cache (remove CMakeCache.txt) otherwise a modified CMake
     project file could result to unwanted behaviour.
