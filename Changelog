Aften TODO list
---------------
- Channel coupling (this will be a large undertaking)
- Configuration system improvement
- E/AC-3 bitstream format and encoding (need a good decoder & samples first)
- ABR encoding mode
- 2-pass encoding
- Frame parser / analyzer
- AIFF file support for the MAC people
- CAFF file support
- Option to downmix/upmix/resample prior to encoding
    - 2-channel surround-matrix downmix
    - 2-channel headphone downmix
    - Stereo to 5.1 upmix
- Improve DRC implementation
- Psychoacoustic model & delta bit allocation
- Gapless info using auxdata field
- Streaming interface to libaften / internal sample buffer
- Multiple-file commandline input with channel designation
- Better error logging for libaften
